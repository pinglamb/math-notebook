## Introduction

A group is a collection of symmetries of something.

Symmetry of something is just a way of mapping something to itself perserving all the structures.

Examples: Cyclic group of order 5, $$\Z$$ (integers), Symmetric Group $$S_n$$, General Linear Group $$GL_3(\reals)$$, Galosis Group of $$\Complex/\reals$$, Symmetrics of Group $$\Z/n\Z$$, ...

## Axioms for a Group

1. Group is Set with multiplication (composition of symmetries) which is associative

$$
(ab)c = a(bc)
$$

2. **Identity Element** (e.g. $$1, 0, e$$)

$$
1a = a1 = a
$$

3. Symmetry has **Inverse** ($$a^{-1}$$)

$$
a^{-1}a = aa^{-1} = 1
$$

## Goal of Group Theory

1. Classify all groups (up to isomorphism)
2. Classify all the ways a group is symmetries of something (Representation Theory)
