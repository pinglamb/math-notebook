# Vector Spaces

The common geometric definition of a vector is a quantity with both a magnitude and a direction in space. The key algebrabic property about vectors is that given vectors $$v_1, v_2, ... v_n$$ and scalers $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n,$$ we can form the linear combination $$\lambda_1v_1 + \lambda_2v_2 + ... + \lambda_nv_n$$ of the vectors and this is again a vector.
