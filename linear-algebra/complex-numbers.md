# Complex Numbers

## Definition

A complex number is a number $$z \in \Complex$$ of the form $$z = a + bi$$ with $$a, b \in \R$$. We called $$a = \text{Re}(z)$$ the real part and $$b = \text{Im}(z)$$ the imaginary part.

## Basic Arithmetic

Let $$z_1 = a + bi$$ and $$z_2 = c + di$$, we have:

### Addition and Subtraction

Similar to vector addition,

$$
z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i
$$

Geometrically, it can be thought as two vectors on the complex plane with the sum of them being the vector formed by joining them head to tail.

We can see that $$(\Complex, +)$$ forms a group with identity $$0$$ and additive inverse $$(-a) + (-b)i$$. Subtraction is defined as adding the additive inverse, hence

$$
z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + (b - d)i
$$

### Multiplication and Division

Given $$i^2 = -1$$, we get the following by expanding the terms:

$$
z_1z_2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
$$

$$(\Complex, \times)^\ast$$ is also a group with identity $$1$$. To find the inverse, we need to find $$c, d$$  in terms of $$a, b$$ such that $$ac - bd = 1$$ and $$ad + bc = 0$$. Hence,

$$
z^{-1} = {1 \over z} = {a \over a^2 + b^2} + {-b \over a^2 + b^2}i
$$

Division is defined as multiplying the inverse

$$
{z_1 \over z_2} = z_1z_2^{-1}
$$

## Complex Conjugate

### Definition

The complex conjugate $$\bar{z}$$ of $$z = a + bi$$ is

$$
\bar{z} = a - bi
$$

Geometrically, $$z$$ and $$\bar{z}$$ are mirror images of each other in the real axis.

Also, base on definition, we have

$$
\overline{(\overline{z})} = z
$$

### Properties

Conjugation is _distributive_ over addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, hence

$$
\begin{aligned} \overline{z_1 \pm z_2} &= \overline{z_1} \pm \overline{z_2} \\ \overline{z_1z_2} &= \overline{z_1} \cdot \overline{z_2} \\ \overline{{z_1 \over z_2}} &= {\overline{z_1} \over \overline{z_2}} \end{aligned}
$$

From the above, we can conclude the following as well

$$
\begin{aligned} \overline{z^{-1}} &= (\overline{z})^{-1} \\ \overline{z^n} &= (\overline{z})^n \end{aligned}
$$

Also, base on the definition, we have

$$
z\bar{z} = a^2 + b^2
$$

which is always real and non-negative.

With that, we can convert complex fraction to a complex number by

$$
{ z_1 \over z_2} = {z_1 \over z_2} \cdot {\overline{z_2} \over \overline{z_2}} = {ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2} + {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2}i
$$

## Modulus

### Definition

The _modulus_ $$|z|$$ of $$z$$ is defined by

$$
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

which is the length of line segment from $$0$$ to $$z$$.

### Properties

From the definition, we can see that

$$
\begin{aligned} |\bar{z}| &= |z| \\ z\overline{z} &= |z|^2 \\ |z_1z_2| &= |z_1||z_2|  \end{aligned}
$$

Geometrically, $$|z_1 - z_2|$$ **is the distance between the two points** $$z_1$$ **and** $$z_2$$. We have the following inequalities about modulus:

$$
\begin{aligned} |\text{Re}(z)| &\le |z| \\ |\text{Im}(z)| &\le |z| \\ |z_1 + z_2 + ... + z_n| &\le |z_1| + |z_2| + ... + |z_n| \\ |z_1 - z_3| &\le |z_1 - z_2| + |z_2 + z_3| \\ ||z_1| - |z_2|| &\le |z_1 \pm z_2| \end{aligned}
$$

## Argument

### Definition

The _argument_ $$\arg(z)$$ of $$z$$ is defined by

$$
\arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left({b \over a}\right)
$$

which is the angle $$\theta$$ between the positive real axis and the line segment from $$0$$ to $$z$$ measured in the anti-clockwise direction.

$$\arg(z)$$ has a period of $$2\pi$$ and $$\tan^{-1}$$ is single valued on the interval $$(-{\pi \over 2}, {\pi \over 2})$$, the following formula gives the principal value of $$\theta \in (-\pi, \pi]$$:

$$
\theta = 2\tan^{-1} \left( {b \over a + |z|} \right)
$$

### Properties

We can later see that with the polar representation of complex number,

$$
\begin{aligned} \arg(z_1z_2) &= \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2) \\ \arg(z^{-1}) &= \arg(\bar{z}) = - \arg(z) \end{aligned}
$$

## Polar Representation

### By Cosine/Sine Functions

For $$z = x + yi$$, base on the definition of modulus $$r = |z|$$ and argument $$\theta = \arg(z)$$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned} x &= r\cos\theta \\ y &= r\sin\theta \end{aligned}
$$

Therefore,

$$
z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
$$

### By Exponential Function

Consider the [Taylor's expansion](exponential-cosine-and-sine-functions.md) of $$e^x$$/$$\exp(x)$$, $$\sin(x)$$ and $$\cos(x)$$, we have

$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
$$

Hence,

$$
z = re^{i \theta}
$$

### Geometric Interpretation of Multiplication

Given $$z_1 = r_1(\cos\theta_1 + i\sin\theta_1)$$ and $$z_2 = r_2(\cos\theta_2 + i\sin\theta_2)$$,

$$
\begin{aligned} z_1z_2 &= r_1r_2(\cos\theta_1 + i\sin\theta_1)(\cos\theta_2 + i\sin\theta_2) \\ &= r_1r_2[(\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2 - \sin\theta_1\sin\theta_2) + i(\cos\theta_1\sin\theta_2 + \sin\theta_1\cos\theta_2)] \\ &= r_1r_2[\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)] \end{aligned}
$$

Similarily, in exponential form,

$$
z_1z_2 = (r_1e^{i\theta_1})(r_2e^{i\theta_2}) = r_1r_2e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

Hence, geometrically, multiplication of $$z_1$$ by $$z_2$$ scales $$z_1$$ by $$|z_2|$$ and rotates $$z_1$$ by $$\arg(z_2)$$.

### Properties

As the complex conjugate of $$z$$ is $$\bar{z} = a - bi$$, base on the polar representation, we can see that $$\arg(\bar{z}) = -\arg(z)$$, therefore

$$
\bar{z} = re^{-i\theta} = r(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
$$

As $$e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$$ and $$e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta$$,

$$
\begin{aligned} \cos\theta &= {1 \over 2} \left( e^{i \theta} + e^{-i \theta}\right) \\ \sin\theta &= {1 \over 2i} \left( e^{i \theta} - e^{-i \theta}\right) \end{aligned}
$$

On the other hand, consider $$z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = re^{i\theta} =1$$, the solution is $$r = 1$$ and $$\theta = 2k\pi$$ with $$k \in \Z$$.

## Roots of Unity

Let $$n$$ be a positive integer. The n-th roots of unity are the distinct complex numbers $$1, \omega, \omega^2, ..., \omega^{n-1}$$, where $$\omega = e^{2\pi i/n}$$, which are the $$n$$ distinct solutions of $$z^n = 1$$.

\[Proof] $$\omega^n = e^{2\pi i} = 1$$. Let $$k \in \{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1\}$$, $$(\omega^k)^n = (\omega^n)^k = 1$$. Therefore, $$1, \omega, \omega^2, ..., \omega^{n-1}$$ are solutions of $$z^n = 1$$. They are obviously distinct because $$\arg(\omega^k) = 2\pi k/n$$. Conversely, suppose $$z = re^{i\theta}$$ is a solution of $$z^n = 1$$, we have $$z^n = r^ne^{in\theta} = 1$$. Therefore, $$r^n = 1$$ and $$n\theta = 2k\pi$$ with $$k \in \Z$$. Hence, we have $$r = 1$$ and by limiting $$0 \le \theta < 2\pi$$, $$\theta = 2k\pi/n$$ with $$k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$$.

The result can be generalized to equation $$z^n = w$$ with $$w \not= 0$$. Let $$w = re^{i\theta}$$ and $$z_0 = r^{1/n}e^{i\theta/n}$$, then $$z_0^n = w$$. Therefore, $$(z/z_0)^n = 1$$. Hence, $$z_0, z_0\omega, z_0\omega^2, ..., z_0\omega^{n-1}$$ are the n distinct solutions.

Furthermore, following from the sum of geometric series and $$\omega^n = 1$$,

$$
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + ... + \omega^{n-1} = {1 - \omega^n \over 1 - \omega} = 0
$$

Geometrically, the n-th roots of unity are the vertices of a regular n-gon on the complex plane, which are evenly spaced around a circle.

## Logarithms and Powers

### Definition

For $$z \in \Complex$$, $$\log(z)$$ is defined as "the" solution $$w$$ of $$e^w = z$$. Hence, by definion, we have

$$
\exp(\log(z)) = z
$$

and given $$w = \log(z)$$,

$$
\begin{aligned} \log(\exp(w)) &= \log[\exp(\log(z))] \\ &= \log[z] \\ &= w \end{aligned}
$$

Let $$z = re^{i\theta}$$ and $$w = x + yi$$, by definition, we have $$e^{x + yi} = (e^x)(e^{iy}) =re^{i\theta}$$, therefore

$$
\begin{aligned} x &= \log(r) = \log(|z|) \\ y &= \theta + 2k\pi = \arg(z) \end{aligned}
$$

Hence,

$$
\log(z) = \log(|z|) + i\arg(z)
$$

which is multi-valued as $$\arg(z)$$ is multi-valued function. The principal value of $$\log(z)$$ is $$-\pi < \arg(z) = \text{Im}(\log(z)) \le \pi$$.

With complex logarithms, we can have $$\log(-1) = \log(1) + i\pi$$, which has no solution in real.

### Properties

Similar to $$\log(x)$$ with $$x \in \R$$, we have

$$
\log(z_1z_2) = \log(z_1) + \log(z_2)
$$

### Complex Powers

Similar to $$x^a = e^{a\log x} = \exp(a \log x)$$ with $$x \in \R_{> 0}$$, we have for $$z \not = 0$$ and $$z, w \in \Z$$,

$$
z^w = e^{w \log z}
$$

Since $$\log(z)$$ is multi-valued, $$z^w$$ is only defined to an arbitrary multiple of $$e^{2k\pi i w}$$.

## De Moivre's Theorem

For $$\theta \in \R$$ and $$n \in \Z$$,

$$
\cos n\theta + i\sin n\theta = (\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^n
$$

\[Proof] As $$\cos \theta + i\sin \theta = e^{i\theta}$$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned} \cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta &= e^{i(n\theta)} \\ &= (e^{i\theta})^n \\ &= (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^n \end{aligned}
$$

The theorem can be extended to $$\theta, n \in \Complex$$ with $$\cos n \theta + i \sin n \theta$$ equals to one of the values of $$(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^n$$.

## Lines and Circles in the Complex Plane

### Lines

For $$z_0, w \in \Complex$$ with $$w \not = 0$$ and varying $$\lambda \in \R$$, the equation

$$
z = z_0 + \lambda w
$$

represents points on a straight line passing through $$z_0$$ and parallel to $$w$$, which is similar to point slope form.

As $$\lambda \in \R$$, $$\lambda = \bar{\lambda}$$, we have $${z - z_0 \over w} = {\bar{z} - \bar{z_0} \over \bar{w}}$$, therefore

$$
z\bar{w} -\bar{z}w = z_0\bar{w} - \bar{z_0}w
$$

is an alternative representation of the line.

Also, given $$u, v \in \Complex$$, the points that are equidistant from them form a straight line. Therefore,

$$
|z - u|^2 = |z - v|^2
$$

&#x20;is a straight line. As $$|z - u|^2 = (z - u)(\bar{z} - \bar{u})$$ and $$|z - v|^2 = (z - v)(\bar{z} - \bar{v})$$, we have

$$
(\bar{v} - \bar{u})z + (v - u)\bar{z} + |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 0
$$

Hence, let $$a = v -u$$ and $$b = |u|^2 + |v|^2 \in \R$$, we have a general representation

$$
\bar{a}z + a\bar{z} + b = 0
$$

Practically, it will be more useful to represent the straight line passing through two points $$u$$ and $$v$$ as parametric form

$$
z - u = \lambda(v - u)
$$

or

$$
z = (1 - \lambda)u + \lambda v
$$

### Circles

The points on a circle in the complex plane with centre $$w$$ and radius $$r$$ is given by the equation

$$
|z - w| = r
$$

Since $$r^2 = |z - w|^2 = (z - w)(\bar{z} - \bar{w})$$,

$$
z\bar{z} - (z\bar{w} + \bar{z}w) + |w|^2 = r^2
$$
