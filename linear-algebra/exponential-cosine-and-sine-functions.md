# Exponential, Cosine and Sine Functions

The intuition on the meaning $$e^x$$ with $$x \in \Z_{>0}$$ is multiplying $$e$$ by itself $$x$$ times and we also have $$e^{-x} = 1/e^x$$. However, when $$x$$ is irrational, or even complex, this definition is not clear and hence we need a better definition which caters for that. Similarily, the trigonometric functions $$\cos(x)$$ and $$\sin(x)$$ can also be extended beyond $$x$$ being some sort of angles, e.g. $$x \in \Complex$$. The definition of them by power series provides a great extension to evaluate them on different kinds of numbers, with the basic properties preserved.

## Exponential Function

The exponential function, $$\exp(x)$$, is defined by the power series

$$
\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} {x^n \over n!} = 1 + x + {x^2 \over 2!} + ...
$$

For $$x, y \in \R$$,

$$
\begin{aligned} \exp(x)\exp(y) &= \left( \sum {x^n \over n!} \right) \left( \sum {y^n \over n!} \right) \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infin}\sum_{r=0}^{n} {x^{n-r} \over (n-r)!}{y^{r} \over (r)!} \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} {1 \over n!} \sum_{r=0}^{n} {n! \over r!(n-r)!}x^{n-r}y^{r} \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} {(x+y)^n \over n!} \\ &= \exp(x+y) \end{aligned}
$$

From the power series definition, we have

$$
\exp(0) = 1
$$

We then define

$$
\exp(1) = e
$$

As $$\exp(0) = \exp(1 - 1) = \exp(1)\exp(-1) = (e)\exp(-1) = 1$$, we have

$$
\exp(-1) = 1/e = e^{-1}
$$

We can see that, by induction, for $$n \in \Z$$,

$$
e^n = \exp(n)
$$

Similarily, we can continue to extend the defintion for $$x$$ being rational, irrational and even complex number, with the consistency maintained. Eventually, we have $$\Q$$for $$z \in \Complex$$,

$$
\exp(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} {z^n \over n!}
$$

## Trigonometric Functions

Similarily, we have the definion of cosine and sine base on power series

$$
\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} (-1)^n {x^{2n} \over (2n)!}
$$

$$
\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} (-1)^n {x^{2n+1} \over (2n+1)!}
$$

which allows us to extend the definition to having $$x \in \Complex$$.

## Relationship between them

When $$x \in \R$$, we don't really see a relationship between them as $$\exp(x)$$ appears to be ever-growing function and $$\cos(x)$$ and $$\sin(x)$$ are periodic functions oscillating between $$1$$ and $$-1$$.

However, with the extension of defintion to complex number, we see an astonishing connection between them:

$$
\begin{aligned} \exp(ix) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} {(ix)^n \over n!} = 1 + ix - {x^2 \over 2!} - i{x^3 \over 3!} + ... \\ &= \left( 1 - {x^2 \over 2!} + {x^4 \over 4!} + ...\right) + i\left( x - { x^3 \over 3!} + {x^5 \over 5!} + ... \right) \\ &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} (-1)^n {x^{2n} \over (2n)!} + i \sum_{n=0}^{\infin} (-1)^n {x^{2n+1} \over (2n+1)!} \\ &= \cos(x) + i\sin(x)\end{aligned}
$$

It is such an important result that we have to state again,

$$
\exp(ix) = e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x
$$

It produces what is probably the most striking formula in mathematics, namely

$$
e^{i\pi} = -1
$$

## Remarks

Most of the proof above aims to illustrate the ideas behind and should not be considered rigorous. As the power series are infinite sum, a rigorous proof has to consider the convergence of the series in different situations.&#x20;
