# Vectors

The common geometric definition of a vector is a quantity with both a magnitude and a direction in space. The key algebrabic property about vectors is that given vectors $$v_1, v_2, ... v_n$$ and scalers $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n,$$ we can form the linear combination $$\lambda_1v_1 + \lambda_2v_2 + ... + \lambda_nv_n$$ of the vectors and this is again a vector. We familiarize ourselves by studying the vectors in three-dimensional space $$\R^3$$ first.

## Definition

The three-dimentional space $$\R^3$$ is defined by

$$
\R^3 = \Set{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) | x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \R}
$$

A vector $$\bold{x}$$ in $$\R^3$$ can be thought as a point in $$\R^3$$, i.e. $$\bold{x} = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$$. The origin $$\bold{0}$$ in $$\R^3$$ is $$(0, 0, 0)$$.

A linear combination of two vectors in $$\R^3$$ is defined by

$$
\lambda\bold{x} + \mu\bold{y} = (\lambda x_1 + \mu y_1, \lambda x_2 + \mu y_2, \lambda x_3 + \mu y_3)
$$
