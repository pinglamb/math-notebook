# Vectors

The discussion here focuses on vectors in 2D and 3D spaces, i.e. $$\R^2$$ and $$\R^3$$. It begins from defining vectors and various operations among them geometrically. It then can be extended to algebraic definitions and generalized to the concept of [vector spaces](vector-spaces.md).

## Definition

In $$\R^2$$ and $$\R^3$$, a vector is a quantity that is specified by a \[positive] _magnitude_ and a _direction_ in space. A vector $$\bold{v}$$ is represented geometrically as a line segment $$\vec{AB}$$ with magnitude $$|\bold{v}|$$ and with direction from $$A$$ to $$B$$.
